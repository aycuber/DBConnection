# DBConnection
Project Name: DBConnection

Application Description: Rowers in the morning have to check their phone for all aspects of what they should expect at practice: 
What's the weather? 
Wind conditions? Tide? 
What location am I rowing at? 
Lineups?
This takes a lot of time to check all of these different platforms at 5 AM in the morning. This application approaches this time consuming problem by giving one platform where rowers can see all the information they need to be prepared for practice.

Features + Tools/Technologies: Weather API: Calls the API for weather at Briones Resevoir and Oakland Estuary. Tide API: Calls the API for the tide at the Oakland Estuary. Chatting platform: Allows the coaches and athletes to communicate locations, lineups, etc. - will need to implement a chatting feature and a database to store the messages. Also needs to implement roles: coxswain, rowers, coaches, Dave.

Timeline: 
April 18: Implement Weather API for both locations
April 19: Implement Tide API for the Oakland Estuary
April 20: Implement chatting functionality
April 21: Implement a database to store messages
April 22: Implement a page that allows coaches to input lineups and allows athletes to view the lineups

Brady Wojnovich and I will complete the work together in person for every feature - in-person
